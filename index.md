##### WELCOME TO WAMTA 2024\!

The WAMTA 2024 workshop is scheduled as a <b>hybrid</b> event in February 2024 and will be
held at Knoxville, TN, USA. 
{: .lead}

As our compute capacity grows, science simulations are not only becoming
bigger, but more complex. Simulations are carried out at multiple scales
and using multiple kinds of physics at once. Boundaries are irregular,
grids are irregular, computational domains can be dynamic and complex.
In such scenarios, the ideal way to parallelize often cannot be
statically determined. At the same time, hardware is becoming more
heterogeneous and difficult to program. Increasingly, scientists are
turning to asynchronous, dynamic parallelism in order to make the best
use of increasingly challenging hardware. As a result, numerous
frameworks, platforms, and specialized languages have sprung up to
answer this need.

The objectives of this workshop are to bring together experts in
asynchronous many-task frameworks, developers of science codes,
performance experts, and hardware vendors to discuss the
state-of-the-art techniques needed to program, analyze, benchmark, and
profile these codes to achieve maximum performance possible from modern
machines. This workshop will promote a dialogue between these
communities, and help identify challenges and opportunities for
advancement in all the disciplines they represent.

The topics of interest include, but are by no means limited to:

  - Novel task-based runtime environments
  - Experiences of using task-based runtime environments for large
    applications
  - Experiences comparing task-based runtime environments
  - Experiences gathered from porting one large-scale parallel solution
    to another, e.g., MPI to Charm++, etc.
  - Profiling and performance monitoring of task-based environments
  - Benchmarks for task-based runtimes
  - Tools for debugging programs using task-based runtimes
  - Challenges to task-based runtimes in scaling to large clusters
  - Hardware challenges and solutions in using task-based environments
